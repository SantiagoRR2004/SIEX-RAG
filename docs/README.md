# Retrieval Augmented Generation

## Overview

This is a project for a subject called "Sistemas Expertos" (Expert Systems) that accounted for 25% of the final grade. It was made by a team of 2 people. The submission took place on Wednesday, the 29th of January of 2025, and earned a grade of 10 out of 10 points.

## Project Summary

For this project we had to create an assistant that provides information on computer security using LLMs and RAG. The assistant is based on the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/). A LangChain model was used to generate the responses. The data in json format for the database of the RAG was given to us in this [url](https://ccia.esei.uvigo.es/docencia/SIEX/2425/practicas/techniques_enterprise_attack.json) and we used the dataset [dattaraj/security-attacks-MITRE](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dattaraj/security-attacks-MITRE) from huggingface to validate the model.
